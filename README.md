# Nava909-Source

This is the Nava 909 firmware code (version 1.017 from here https://github.com/e-licktronic/Nava-v1.0-code) ported for development using PlatformIO and VS Code rather than Arduino IDE.

No other changes have been made to the code other than to get it to build and compile. I have only got it to build - it is not tested on my Nava! YMMV

If you read the forums http://www.e-licktronic.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=864, this code has lots of issues, which have mostly been solved by the creator (e-licktronic) and another person (zabox) but it's closed source so no chance to assist and share.

The idea here is to try and build on the public version, improve it and then share it with the community.

Any assistance greatly appreciated! 

It was a bit of a pain to get it to compile correctly and I'm still not sure it will work, so if someone can take a look and as well that would be awesome.

Thanks!!!!
